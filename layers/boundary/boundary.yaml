  description: |
      Contains administrative boundaries as linestrings.
      Until z4 [Natural Earth data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) is used after which
      OSM boundaries ([`boundary=administrative`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative))
      are present from z5 to z14 (also for maritime boundaries with `admin_level <= 2` at z4).
      OSM data contains several [`admin_level`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
      but for most styles it makes sense to just style `admin_level=2` and `admin_level=4`.
  fields:
    admin_level: |
        OSM [admin_level](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
        indicating the level of importance of this boundary.
        The `admin_level` corresponds to the lowest `admin_level`
        the line participates in.
        At low zoom levels the Natural Earth boundaries are mapped to the equivalent admin levels.
    icgc_id:
      description:
          Identificador Ãºnic de l'ICGC.
    name: The name of the entity.
    class:
      description: |
          Distinguish between countries, 'vegueries', provinces,
          regions and municipalities.
          Use **class** to separately style the different places and build
          a text hierarchy according to their importance.
      values:
        - country
        - vegueria
        - provincia
        - comarca
        - municipi
    rank:
      description: |
        Countries, states and the most important cities all have a
        **rank** to boost their importance on the map.
        The **rank** field for counries and states ranges from
        `1` to `6` while the **rank** field for cities ranges from
        `1` to `10` for the most important cities
        and continues from `10` serially based on the
        local importance of the city (derived from population and city class).
        You can use the **rank** to limit density of labels or improve
        the text hierarchy.
        The rank value is a combination of the Natural Earth
        `scalerank`, `labelrank` and `datarank` values for countries
        and states and for cities consists out of a shifted
        Natural Earth `scalerank` combined with a local rank
        within a grid for cities that do not have a Natural Earth `scalerank`.
