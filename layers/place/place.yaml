layer:
  id: "place"
  description: |
      The place layer consists out of [countries](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dcountry),
      [states](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dstate) and [cities](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place).
      Apart from the roads this is also one of the more important layers to create a beautiful map.
      We suggest you use different font styles and sizes to create a text hierarchy.
  fields:
    name: The OSM [`name`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) value of the POI.
    "name:latin": Name of the POI.
    class:
      description: |
          Original value of the
          [`place`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place) tag.
          Distinguish between continents, countries, states and
          places like settlements or smaller entities.
          Use **class** to separately style the different places and build
          a text hierarchy according to their importance.
      values:
      - continent
      - country
      - state
      - province
      - city
      - town
      - village
      - hamlet
      - suburb
      - quarter
      - neighbourhood
      - isolated_dwelling
    rank:
      description: |
          Countries, states and the most important cities all have a
          **rank** to boost their importance on the map.
          The **rank** field for counries and states ranges from
          `1` to `6` while the **rank** field for cities ranges from
          `1` to `10` for the most important cities
          and continues from `10` serially based on the
          local importance of the city (derived from population and city class).
          You can use the **rank** to limit density of labels or improve
          the text hierarchy.
          The rank value is a combination of the Natural Earth
          `scalerank`, `labelrank` and `datarank` values for countries
          and states and for cities consists out of a shifted
          Natural Earth `scalerank` combined with a local rank
          within a grid for cities that do not have a Natural Earth `scalerank`.
